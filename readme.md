# Express Starter

Fork the repo; create an express.js app.

## Features

* skeleton express.js app structure
* babel preconfigured with stage-2+ (es6/es7 etc)
* eslint preconfigured
* npm preconfigured
* dotenv for faking ENV variables

## App Development

Start the development environment by running `npm run dev`.

Create and edit files in the `src` directory; the project is preconfigured to transpile ES6+ into ES5.

## Prod App

The production app must be built once before running. To build the app, run `npm run build`.
Once the app has been built, you can run it via `npm start`.
